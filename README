PubSubPostBin
==============

  Using http://postbin.org/ for debugging PubSubHubbub callbacks


Overview
---------

http://postbin.org/ is an excelent service for debugging webhooks. 
In the moment however it cannot be used directly like a callback from
PubSubHubbub hubs (like for example Superfeedr or http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/)
because:

 - It does not pass the GET PSHB hubs verification for callbacks
 - PSHB hubs are sending Atom entries, which are not very human-eyes friendly.

The purpose of this project is to create a very thin wrapper around PostBin for
fixing the two issues mentioned above.


Usage
------

 - Create new page on http://postbin.org/ (for example http://www.postbin.org/xXzZaa)
 - On the PubSubHubbub subscribe page for "Callback" enter:

   http://callback.example.com/xXzZaa   (adjust for your install)

 - If using Superfeedr, on your "Settings" page search: 

  ...The content of the page should just be "1234abs4321"...

 - Set the Notifications to "PubSubhubbub" and for "Webhook URL" enter: 

  http://callback.example.com/superfeedr/1234abs4321/xXzZaa   (adjust for your install)
