PubSubPostBin
==============

  Using http://postbin.org/ for debugging PubSubHubbub callbacks


Overview
---------

http://postbin.org/ is an excelent service for debugging webhooks. 
In the moment however it cannot be used directly like a callback from
PubSubHubbub hubs (like for example Superfeedr or http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/)
because:

- It does not pass the GET PSHB hubs verification for callbacks
- PSHB hubs are sending Atom entries, which are not very human-eyes friendly.

The purpose of this project is to create a very thin wrapper around PostBin for
fixing the two issues mentioned above.
